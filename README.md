# 👋 Hey, I’m Jonas!

I currently work as a Project Manager in the financial industry and I'm passionate about the craft of coding and workflow design. I strive to help people be more productive and nimble. My mission is to help developers and practitioners to be better communicators through the craft of programming and the art of writing. 
I believe the biggest challenges in tech aren't technical, they are human. I have been working at the intersection of business and tech for 10+ years, both as a consultant and employee. I have just started to learn web development because I realised it's so much fun to start turning ideas into reality.


👀 I’m interested in web development and the software engineering craft.

🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JS.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
