👋 Hey, I’m @jasmourad. Father of 3, full time employed and probably overcommitting at the moment. But life's too short to not open up for new paths in life.

👀 I’m interested in web development and the software engineering craft.

🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JS.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects.

📫 You can inbox me here on GitHub or hit me with an email at jonasasihlen@gmail.com. I am also active on Twitter as @jasmourad.
